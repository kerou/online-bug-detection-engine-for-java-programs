Software error detection to ensure the reliability of software systems play an important role. There are many software for C or Java static analysis and error detection tools. While these tools have their own characteristics, from different angles of the error detection process, but it has not been a tool in the industrial sector can be widely applied. The project hopes to existing procedures for several key Java tools such as error detection FindBug? And PMD integrated and comprehensive integration of their respective merits of a more comprehensive and effective online Java program error detection system. The project will eventually produce a web-based Java program online error detection engine, the user can page through a particular line of Java on their own procedures to submit error detection [Theory and Practice of National Chiao Tung University Laboratory (STAP) website: http://stap. sjtu.edu.cn](Software.md)
